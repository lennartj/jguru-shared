/**
 * ## JSON mapper using Jackson, handling any class.
 *
 * This convenience implementation, should be used in the following manner
 * within an existing CDI-enabled application such as a WAR:
 *
 * ```java
 * @Producer
 * public class MyJsonProvider extends JacksonJsonAnyMapper {}
 * ```
 *
 * Deserializing objects of type Foo using the MyJsonProvider would be done using a
 * rather odd class-cast construct, namely:
 *
 * ```java
 *  val resurrected = myJsonProvider.readFrom(
 *      Furniture::class.java as Class<Any>,  // A bit weird, but required to coerce Kotlin's type system.
 *      String::class.java,
 *      emptyArray,
 *      jsonType,
 *      emptyMultiValuedMap,
 *      input)
 * ```
 *
 * ### Note!
 *
 * Do not use generics in your implementation. According to ยง3.1 of the JSR-299
 * (CDI) specification:
 *
 * > "If the managed bean class is a generic type, it must have scope @Dependent.
 * > If a managed bean with a parameterized bean class declares any scope other than @Dependent, the
 * > container automatically detects the problem and treats it as a definition error."
